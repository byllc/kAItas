# Decision Tree Components

A decision tree is a very basic example of a machine learning algorithm. It is flowchart-like structure used for decision-making and predictive modeling. It is an example of a basic machine learning algorithm. It is not an LLM, however an LLM is a complex Machine Learning algorithm and we will be building towards that. You have to start somewhere. 

 Here are the basic components of a decision tree:

1. **Root Node**:
   - The topmost node in a decision tree.
   - Represents the entire dataset and the first decision point.

2. **Decision Nodes**:
   - Internal nodes that represent decisions based on feature values.
   - Each decision node splits the data into subsets based on a specific feature and threshold.

3. **Branches**:
   - The connections between nodes.
   - Represent the outcome of a decision and lead to the next node (either another decision node or a leaf node).

4. **Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes)**:
   - The end nodes of the tree.
   - Represent the final outcome or class label for a subset of data.
   - No further splitting occurs at leaf nodes.

5. **Splits**:
   - The criteria used to divide the data at each decision node.
   - Based on feature values and thresholds that maximize the separation of classes or minimize impurity.

## Example of a Simple Decision Tree

Here's a simple example of a decision tree for a binary classification problem:
            [Root Node]
               /   \
          Yes       No
         /            \
[Decision Node]    [Leaf Node]
    /    \             (Class B)
 Yes      No
/           \


In this example:
- The root node represents the entire dataset and the first decision point.
- The decision nodes represent further decisions based on feature values.
- The branches represent the outcomes of the decisions.
- The leaf nodes represent the final class labels (Class A or Class B).

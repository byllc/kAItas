# Simple Math. Building blocks of Machine Learning 

Machine learning is fundamentally built on simple mathematical concepts. At its core, it involves using algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. These algorithms often rely on basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced concepts like linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

## Task: Write a `scalar_multiply` function 

### What?
Create a function that multiplies a scalar n by an array which represents vector. n * [a,b,c,d,...]. THe vector can be of arbitrary size. The multiplication should be elementwise. so [n*a, n*b, n*c, ...]

### Why? 
Scalar multiplication is commonly used in optimization algortithms and other Machine Learning examples and is a basic linear algebra concept. 

## Task: Write a `dot_product` Function 

### What? 
The function should calculate the sum of the products of corresponding elements of two vectors

### Why? 
Used in calculating projections, similarities, and in neural networks.

## Task: Write a `matrix_multiply` Function

### What? 
Create a function that multiplies two matrices together. To keep it simple each matrix can be a two dimensional array of the same size. NxN

### Why? 
Matrix multiplication is a common operation in many machine learning algorithms, especially in neural networks. By understanding and implementing these basic mathematical operations, we can build and train machine learning models to perform a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing.

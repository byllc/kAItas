# Simple Math. Building blocks of Machine Learning 

Machine learning is fundamentally built on simple mathematical concepts. At its core, it involves using algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. These algorithms often rely on basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced concepts like linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.


## Task: Write a `matrix_multiply` Function

### What? 
Create a function that multiplies two matrices together. 

### Why? 
Matrix multiplication is a common operation in many machine learning algorithms, especially in neural networks. By understanding and implementing these basic mathematical operations, we can build and train machine learning models to perform a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing.
